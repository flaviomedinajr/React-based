# React-based-Make-Todos

What is React in programming?

- React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces like basically, the parts of a website you see and use, like buttons, menus, and forms. It lets developers create small, reusable pieces called components, which can be combined to build full websites or apps. This makes the code easier to manage, update, and reuse. React is fast, efficient, and used by big companies like Facebook and Netflix.


I'm excited to stay consistent and keep learning new things with React to improve and demonstrate my skills. I also plan to use React more heavily in this project to showcase my knowledge and experience with it.


This project is about how to build a Todo List with the ability to add new items, using separate files that are connected together to make the app more organized, simple, and clear.
